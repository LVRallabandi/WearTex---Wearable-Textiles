# WearTex---Wearable-Textiles
WearTex are sensor patches with pressure inputs. These patches are made from conductive and resistive textiles. The resistive fabric velostat is placed in between two layers of conductive fabric. The sensor patches can be attached to any wearable textile (non- conductive) and on skin	. The project was implemented using Arduino IDE and microcontroller Arduino UNO.
The project requires only touch/minimal pressure to the patch. The patch has recorded values of pressure input with thumb upto 12 levels and can also be used for devices that require pressure input. WearTex patches in the project are used to control camera application i.e. to capture pictures and record videos and in a music player application, play/pause a song, move to the next song and volume control increase/decrease. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
