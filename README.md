# WearTex---Wearable-Textiles
Using gestures to control apps or electronic devices has been developing rapidly. A few years ago gestures were included into smart phones to capture pictures, screenshots, to lock screens etc. Today, controlling user interactions/apps with gestures has expanded from mobile phones to wearable textiles. Levis Jacquard jacket is the best example for wearable textiles.
zPatches are wearable textile patches which are thin, soft, iron-on textile patch that provide users with an input channel to control an app on their phone with their day-to-day clothing.They can be attached to any piece of cloth or human arms or wrists and can control various actions using gestures. [2]
 For example, shooting while playing a video game, controlling your smart watch with pressure etc.
 
 Using these zPtaches, This project control images capturing and music control usingkm a smart phone.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
