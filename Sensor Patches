1.	Cut the conductive and resistive fabrics in the shape of Circle or square.
(Remember that both conductive layers should not touch each other  )
2.	Place the resistive fabric between both the layers of conductive fabric.
3.	Sew the layers together carefully.
4.	Place the conductive layer electrodes opposite to each other.
5.	The patch can be covered using non-conductive aesthetically pleasing textile.
